# Python Machine Learning Algorithms.

Two broad categories are Supervised and Unsupervised.

## Supervised Learning

Here, a learning signal/ feedback is available to the system; we give it to sample data to learn from. The computer holds example inputs and desired outputs with the goal of learning a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.

One such example of Python Machine Learning will be to search for images on Facebook using keywords centered around the contents of the image.

    * Semi-Supervised Learning- The computer receives an incomplete training signal. This is a training set with some target outputs missing.
    * Active Learning- The computer can secure training labels for only some instances. It also needs to make an optimal choice of objects to secure labels.
    * Reinforcement Learning- In this, the training data comes as feedback on how a program acts in a dynamic environment. Examples of this include driving a vehicle or playing against an opponent.

Steps involved in Supervised Machine Learning-

    * Training
    * Testing

Machine Learning Algorithms for beginners:
    * Decision trees
    * Support Vector Machines
    * Na√Øve Bayes
    * k-nearest neighbor
    * Linear regression

## Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the Python Machine Learning Algorithm receives no labels; we only give the machine a set of inputs. It must rely on itself to find structure in its input. This kind of learning can be a goal or a means toward future learning. We can classify unsupervised learning as-

* Clustering- The act of grouping data inherently. One example of this will be to group consumers by their shopping habits so they can target the right consumers to advertise.
* Association- In association, we identify rules explaining large sets of our data. One example will be to associate books around author/ category.

Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms:
    * K-means clustering
    * Hierarchical clustering

## Steps

Steps in ML with Python include:

    * Collecting data.
    * Filtering data.
    * Analyzing data.
    * Training algorithms.
    * Testing algorithms.
    * Using algorithms for future predictions.

## Applications of Python ML

    * Fighting and filtering webspam and malware
    * Refining search-engine results
    * Virtual Personal Assistants
